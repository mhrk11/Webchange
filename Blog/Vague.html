<h1> Vague </h1>

<p> I understand that before starting anything new, one must ask and answer—Why? For me, “Why” has been mostly vague and something that I have difficulty in figuring out.</p>
 <p> It must have been around class six. And a new teacher had just been assigned as our science-teacher. The guy was a bulky in size, wore glasses, and had Tere-Nam hairstyle. He spoked quite impatiently, maybe because he suffered the way I do sometimes to articulate my intentions and thoughts into words. He spoked with quite difficulty but his passion was radiant: He wanted to inspire his students to become something more than that was being preached in our school. He wanted us to think and ponder on ourselves. Force us to use our creativity. Embrace challenges. He was a hell of teacher. Maybe a teacher like that only could have asked this question for the first time to us: “Why are you studying?” </p>
<p> And I remember answering: “Because I want to be an educated man who is respected.”</p>
<p> I wish I could go back and ask my younger Self: “What the Fuck is wrong with you, bitch?”</p>
<p> I have my reasons for why I would say so to myself. First being, this simply represents my need for validation from people, and being liked by all—which again isn’t wrong if it is a by-product rather than the major goal. But I again think back, what else could I have answered anyways— “Preserve Human Civilization and take them to Mars?” Seriously, do you think Elon Musk would have replied so?  I am not Elon Musk, but I like to use my imaginations to it fullest.</p> 
<p> There is one thing for sure: It never is about Money, Fame or Chicks. It is always more than that. I sometimes feel it, but other times I am back with selfishness. I haven’t actually seen the world from those eyes and understood with those perspectives. </p>
<p> When I was in Smart Club as a CCT, I had a worse time personally. I was already distrusted, and had some hectic routines. I wasn’t getting paid or was getting any validation or anything. But I just hung in there and stayed there till the end of tenure no matter what, not because I felt any obligation but because I wanted to do. I did it for myself. I wanted to complete the tenure with the efforts I could put. I again think back, what if I had left it in between—it would have shattered me from inside. I never cared about what would happen in the end, I just cared about if I did everything that I could do to make the best of the platform for others who were starters there—like the way I was once. </p>
<p> So, if anyone asks me today: Why are you doing what you are doing? I will say, I love this process of suffering, and of course the validation that I get for this is something fulfilling. It inspires me to do more. </p>
