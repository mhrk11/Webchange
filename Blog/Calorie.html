		<h1> Calorie Myth: My Take On It</h1>

		<p> 
			I finished the book on Saturday Night. I was in hospital. No nothing has happened to me, but my Bhanja—there is nothing of concern. He is only 10 days older and jaundice seems to get catch infants. That’s why he was admitted just before a day before his Nwaran (Naming Ceremony, in case any non-Hindu ever read this blog). So there was I, reading. Because time in Hospital is like a sink: you never know when you are going to fell in. I was there sitting outside Canteen, it was dark already and since I read books in my phone, light is never a concern. However, I don’t like reading in mobile phones, but what can I do, if he doesn’t earn and money is always a problem. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		I felt quite good when I finished the book. It took me about a month. I could have finished earlier, but stuff kept happening in between. Once or twice, I started reading other books—Daring Greatly and Why Nation Failed, which I didn’t complete because they were either boring or difficult. </p>


<p>So there I was with—The Calorie Myth by Jonathan Bailor. What I feel after I read the book is totally different than what I thought. It is such a guide to every one who wants to get control or know how body responds and how can we better control it. </p>

<p>“Exercising more and eating less” that we have heard so far is factually proven wrong by Jonathan Bailor. He advice to eat more starchy vegetables, protein-dense to lose weight and live healthier. About exercise, he suggests to workout only about half an hour to an hour per week, but smarter exercises. That means, jogging and other light exercise don’t have as much impact as high Intensity Interval Training, and he has explained every kind of home-feasible and gym-oriented workout in the book. </p>

<p>The most important thing that I have taking away from this book is about Set-points. The idea is that our body fat-loss or gain is biological, that means hormones play an important role in our body weight, math doesn’t. Taking in less calorie than burning approach isn’t effective and can be fatal. Our body likes to stay in equilibrium. And that equilibrium is set by the quality of food that we eat. If we eat more starched and sugar-filled food, and have less protein in it, it is likely that our equilibrium is going to higher, and our body will do everything to reach that body-weight, no matter how much we exercise or eat less. That equilibrium is our set point. Higher the set-point, heavier we get.  In fact, eating less and exercising more can cause our set-point to get higher. Since, eating less means our body will try to respond to scarcity of food and will start storing fat to burn later to make us survive as we are eating less. For a short period of time, we may lose weight, but our fat-storing capacity has increased, our set-point has increased, so the moment we go back to old eating habit or increase our calorie intake, we have put ourselves into a place where our body wants to eat more and store more. </p>

<p>About exercise. Let me be honest, I felt quite discouraged to workout when I read this book. Because Jonathan has the same approach to workouts too. He argues that working out often and more can have reverse effect on our body, as it elevates our sugar craving, and makes us go back to same habit of eating junk and stuff. I am a victim of this. I have been working out for a more than three months now. And, well, I haven’t seen as much progress as I have worked out. Because, even after missing my workout for a week, I can feel my body disorienting. That must be because of my diet. But let me honest, after I take intense workout session, I do get pumped up with energy, but my sugar-craving elevates too. And maybe that’s why my muscles haven’t built so well. I don’t think I am changing my workout routines, but definitely going to stop those extra reps and extra things I used to do, but stick to workouts which are intense and makes me pumped up with energy. This times, I know what my problem is, and what has been hurdling my way to keep myself lean—it’s diet. The idea is to avoid sugar and junk food, and eat food that have more fiber, protein and water in it. I can’t totally change my diet, because my hotel-wala-auntie cooks and I eat, but I can control my other habits: Snacks, breakfast, and drinks. I have been avoiding typical nepali Snacks—momo, Chowmin, and Samosa, and have replaced it with Roti-Tarkari; my breakfast to bhijeko chana; and I have recently started to drink protein-shakes. Let’s see how I feel after a month when I decrease my sugar-consumption and elevate other nutrients.  </p>

<p>This book was a wonderful read. I feel good that I read this book. So many misconception that I had about human-body, weight-loss and workouts were factually tackled. I can’t totally embrace every advice given in this book, however, I have definitely changing my few habits. I would recommend everyone to read this book. It is readable, scientific, (except few chapters) interesting and helpful. </p>
