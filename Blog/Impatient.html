<h1 id="heading"> Impatient Unfocused Desperate </h1>
April 13, 2019

<p> I don’t think I am ever going to put this in web, but if I do, this statement would be catchy way to get a reader’s attention. The three words that I wrote above “Impatient Unfocused and Desperate” quite defines my contemporary mental situation or my emotional-state, you can say. I have no shame in admitting that I feel fucked up most of the times, yes, most of the times. Now, let me tell you what do I mean by my “Fucked Up” State. </p>
<p> You see, it begins from that day from when I am aware about being aware and I didn’t know. It was school time; I still remember that feelings. I am talking about my childhood, in case if my implicit intentions didn’t get cleared there. Anyways, it must been morning or so and I remember thinking about what am I, how I feel what I am feeling, am I God, is this what God means whose stories I have heard all my childhood because I can feel, and am conscious of something which I don’t know if others are or not, and it seemed that I was the center of attraction of everything that this universe was going through because I felt so, and I didn’t know about others and if they had feelings. Since, I was unaware of their consciousness or I didn’t understand others, to interpret myself as something of a different entity suited my rational mind by then. Well, I can see my selfishness and narcissism roots back to my childhood. I know, I know, that this is no excuse for hurting others by being selfish and all.</p>
<p> You see, I am not here to generalize intention, life and all. I am here simply stating things that I feel about myself. So, let me continue.</p> 
<p> As my days went on, or I would like to say when my selfishness and pride started to get hurt, I started realizing that Life was more of challenge to be competed upon—you know, those toppers rivalry. Maybe that was the time, I realized I was just another fucker trying to prove something to others and if I won’t work hard enough, I would lose my status and the attention that I used to get from my friends and crush. I have diary which dates back to my class 7 mentality, and when I read it, I realized how serious of an asshole I was: as if I was the Truman in the Truman Show. I always thought everyone was a narcissistic bastard who had one purpose in life that is to make me suffer. It took me about six years to realize that Every self-breathing fucker here is doing things to make oneself happy and they do extreme stuff to get there just like I have been doing. And Unknowingly and almost without any intention (Most of the times), we hurt others in the process. Well, everyone aspires to be a wealthy, healthy, happy assholes. So, you aspire to be same just like I do, then I can pretty much bet that we are similar. I am pretty sure, the day when you felt your consciousness for the first time, you related it with stories you heard in your childhood or read in case if your family members were dumb or you were deaf, whatever.  And then you went on rambling and mixing your own interpretation about yourself and life. </p>
<p>  And I have always listened to the statement that “Life will be better tomorrow and we will be happier. And I think this is the number one fucked-up statement I came across. Well, I don’t think my life will better anywhere tomorrow if I am the same today. Change is what today is. I don’t think I will ever live tomorrow. You know, those chessy quotes that you see in Facebook—“Love Your Work” “Never Give Up”. I didn’t come across these through Facebook, there were in the School’s Bulletin where we used to get those stuff back then, and I used to draw all kind of conclusions from them. I even used to force myself to love my studies, or the things I used to do. That’s where I got exposed to this “Self-Help” Industry. And let me tell you, I think I felt more obscure and fucked-up after that. </p>
<p> I am not saying that the books that I read were worthless, they actually made me understand a lot of concepts that eventually I understood were different than they way they were preached, but what I am saying here is that the books made me feel, in a subconscious level, that I was living a life which was not fulfilling and made me more serious than ever, you can think of it like I was even forcing to love things that I was doing, instead of just doing them to make myself feel better—which itself is contradicting. And now this may seem counterintuitive, but I have started to understand the basic and the most fundamental truth of life is that you can’t be happy all the time and happiness is just a state of emotion, not a destiny. And there isn’t destiny out there anyways anywhere, it is all the journey. When I look at famous people and think why they commit suicide, that quite answers the question, life isn’t about a bigass achievement waiting for me in my future, it is all here while I am typing these words and you are reading. I know, I am still not being able to explicitly clear these concepts.</p>
<p> But let’s keep going on anyways, that is the part of process because we aren’t perfect about everything and we keep doing the things we like to: Me, writing; you, reading. The biggest mentality challenge that I have faced and have been facing is this mentality that everything that I am doing is making me a better a person. Like a drug addict, I am taking another shot of self-help book advice to live my life and feeling good about it, instead of going out and experiencing myself. Now, this is again counterintuitive, because self-help book may seem like taking an advice from people who are successful where we usually are taking advices anyways, taking advices from them definitely does seem more relevant. But what my concern has been is that I have spent most of my times just reading books and trying to copy the methods told in them, in spite of building myself within, I have performed. </p>
<p> It took me a lot of introspection and time to understand what these self-help books were trying to dictate. For instance, if you have read the book “The secret”, their you will be introduced to the concept of affirmation, gratitude and visualization. Now these aren’t actually techniques, but they are presented as techniques but that is the whole point of the book but since the book assumes the person reading is probably a dumbass who has been totally fucked up, it goes on rambling about stuff which makes look like a chessy guideline for living a fulfilling and complete life. First, that book exaggerates. Second, it deceives the reader from what should have been the key message. These books have overly glorified and objectified success. You aren’t asking from the universe for the stuff you want by carrying a rock in your hand and being grateful for it—which seems like begging and I will co-rrelate it with people going to temples and begging for stuff by worshipping.</p>
<p> But it is something fundamental, once you start practicing gratitude, you start getting more humble to people and the things they do, and the way you used to react to your situations changes because you have been pushing yourself to see something good to be grateful for every day, and now since you have clarified your brain with what you need, you can clearly see the opportunities lying all before you, where they always used to be but you never gave it a thought. And that’s what the point of religion has been too, it’s the people who fucked it up totally. The idea was to build a sense of self-acceptance, self-righteousness, patience, self-discipline and materialistic-sacrifice(if that’s a word, but you understood) but people interpreted it as “a must”, something that was meant to teach “How to life a better and fulfilling life” became “How Not to live a life” with all those must and must nots.</p> 
<p> You see, I have craved for acceptance a lot. Maybe, that’s why I read books on self-help all the times. I feel insecure a hundred times a day. I feel: maybe I am not good enough; maybe if I will read this book my life will change; if I ask help from this, I will avoid making the mistakes and won’t be laughed at; if I do this maybe the other person will like me and won’t hurt—I am done doing all these shits. Seriously, I may come up with a bold statement here by saying “Fuck It” or something, which I came by the way but later erased because that’s not what I feel genuinely. I don’t know what I am honest about too. My search for answers, trying to see the world as a “How to Guide” has left me “Impatient Unfocused Desperate”</p>
